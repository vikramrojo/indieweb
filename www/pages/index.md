## Hi, I'm Vikram Rojo, a product designer, writer, archivist and sometimes developer. I shape developer experience at [WorkOS](https://workos.com) to make enterprises productive and happy.

Before WorkOS, I was the first product designer for the feature flagging platform [LaunchDarkly](https://launchdarkly.com), working on everything from the core experience to experimentation. I also host [Masala Land](https://twitter.com/masalaland_), a Caribbean Hindustani music archival project. You can find me writing [notes](/posts/) here as well as on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/vikramrojo) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@vikramrojo). I sometimes tinker with Static Sites and CSS Frameworks on [Github](https://github.com/vikramrojo/). This site is wired using 11ty, Indiekit, custom classless CSS and Github as a data store.
