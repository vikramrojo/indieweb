Since starting a new role last year, I've picked up a lot more ownership at work, from product shaping to release. As my role shifts between design and product, I've had to reconsider how I prioritize my week. A simple variation on tracking my week, I use an LRT prefix on tasks to clarify my intuition. There's dozens of jobs that need to be done each week and treating them as equals is a fools errand.

L: Leverage work. Prioritize the time and space for this, it might be a value driver or unlock the team.
R: Required work. These are things that just need to get done. Give yourself permission to be mediocre.
T: Task work. These are barely worth doing. Ideally defer, delegate them or skip it entirely.
