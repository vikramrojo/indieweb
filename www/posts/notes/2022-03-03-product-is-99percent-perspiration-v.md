Product is 99% perspiration, validating the specifics and sweating the details. It’s tempting when starting a project, to be seduced by inspiration and moreover substitute it for the tireless work of research, prototyping, validation and communication.

But the problem with inspiration is that it’s deceptively vague. Once subjected to the specifics of audience, feature set, scale, effort, marketing and so on, things start to look very different.
