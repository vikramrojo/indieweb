Design is clearly more than implementation details, or so we say. While it's easy to quantify specs and feature releases, it's harder to capture to tangible research or avoided obstacles. It probably shouldn't be and design learnings should be tracked but it’s rarely a priority. So the recurring question of should designers code points a misapplication of the design role. I code, barely, but enough to understand the domain I work in, developer tools.

The day to day challenges with software delivery currently are less implementation and more shaping. Less how to build, more what to build and if it’s validated. Designers contributing to implementation rarely makes up for poor discovery. The exceptions being microinteraction design and computational prototypes. So if you had to prioritize between a designer contributing towards research, shaping or development, would you still pick the latter?
