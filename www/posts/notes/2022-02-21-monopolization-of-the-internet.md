Monopolization of the internet and the online behaviors it rewards has been a recurring topic in conversations with friends. So to try and get out from under it, I spent the weekend implementing Indieweb with 11ty on my site. In brief, I draft notes on a micropub client, IndieAuth authenticates my posts which are captured by Netlify functions and posted by a Github repository as Markdown. I like that I can focus on writing and the rest just works with Indieweb.
