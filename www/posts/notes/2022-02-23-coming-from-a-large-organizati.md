Coming from a large organization, one of the things I've had to unlearn is doing things that scale. In early stage companies you often try things that don't scale, until you validate a solution. It doesn't help that one of design's big contributions in the last decade is systems that scale. Beyond design tokens, trying to artificially uphold design consistency can hamper the experiences you design, especially early in a product's lifespan when you don't yet know what experiences will stick. I have a sticky on my desk that reminds me, "Design things that don't scale."
